title: "   In the Garden of Eden The Founding of Astoria, April 1811, the Tonquin - Mark Myers 6/8 â€‹The purpose of this website is to propose the opportunity of producing feature films that leave legacies on the Pacific Northwest Coast. For thousands of years this area was home to some of the wealthiest people on the planet. Now it is home to some of the poorest, monetarily that is. Though rich in natural beauty, culture, and history, the poverty of its inhabitants brings rise to environmental pressures like fish farming, logging, and mining. The record breaking protests of the 1980's and 1990's slowed the devastation in Clayoquot Sound, but nowhere is safe from heavy industry until a sustainable economy relieves poverty once and for all. The breathtaking scenery and stunning traditional artwork of the coast lend themselves beautifully to cinema. By tapping the rich culture and history of the area through the medium of film, and leaving legacies of cultural and environmental revitalization, tourism, education, conservation and restoration, we can help to exercise indigenous rights and titles.
